# REST-API-NodeJS

## About the app

I'm just brushing my dev skills. The front-end is rendered using Pug as a templating engine and the back-end is Node/Express.

## How to run the API

1. Clone the repository.
   `git clone https://github.com/irfanalamt/REST-API-NodeJS.git`
2. In your terminal, navigate to the project root directory.
   `cd REST_API_NodeJS `
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the app.
5. Open your local browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Enjoy!
