# REST-API-NodeJS

## About the app
I'm just brushing my dev skills. The front-end is rendered using Pug as a templating engine and Node/Express back-end.

## How to run the API
1. In your terminal, navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run start` to start the app.

##Enjoy!
